# fourier-animation
An animation which utilizes the Fourier transform to create epicycles. The program doesn't make use of the Tukey-Cooley algorithm; instead, it uses basic integration to allow for lists of points which aren't even in length. I used DillingerLee's template from https://github.com/Team-Code/KA_Offline.
